# Ho ho ho 🎅 

*Advent of Code*, where programming puzzles are told,  
some are fun and some are hard, some I will never solve...

But even with a little shame, a touch of blame,  
In this Advent race, I play the game.  

Some days I’m swift, some days I stall,   
But hey, at least I **tried** at all!  😬

I chase the stars ⭐⭐, but miss a few,  
cool solutions? Oh, that’s true!  

So here’s my code, imperfect and bright,   
Merry Christmas, sometimes I’ll solve it right!
